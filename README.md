[Contribution guidlines](https://github.com/luksan47/mars/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
If not, the easiest thing right now is catching up with our language files. You can find them
[here](https://github.com/luksan47/mars/tree/master/resources/lang). Each folder contains translations a specific
language, where in each file we assign the proper words/sentences to the keys we use in the code.
